We're delighted to make this official !

Louis Warynski, aka **[Chapelier Fou](http://www.icidailleurs.com/chapelier-fou)**, is currently composing the soundtrack of _Les m√©tamorphoses de Mr Kalia_ !

Small excerpt of his biography :

**"**_Continuously exploring the infinite potential of computers, Louis gives free rein to his spontaneity, using violin, guitar, but also an increasing number of vintage synths. An almost disconcerting outcome results from his constant risktaking - Chapelier Fou keeps questioning himself rather than releasing ever the same patterns. But the central elements that forged his style are still here to be found._**"**

We've been fans of his music for a long time, listening to his albums for countless hours at the studio and were psyched to discover his enthusiasm on the project.

He's been composing some great tracks for some metamorphoses already that we can't wait to share with you!
Here is a preview of the track he composed for the drawers scene :
