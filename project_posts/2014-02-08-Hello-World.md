### Hi everyone, welcome to our project page!

[Beatrice Lartigue](http://epure.it/) and [I (Cyril Diagne)](http://kikko.fr) are two members of the french collective [LAB212](http://lab212.org)

We're joining the competition as a duo and we will try to share as much as possible of our journey towards making a new interactive installation.
We really want to **play the game** and commited ourselves to create something from the very ground up, including the idea. All we know so far is that we want to create a **poetic digital adventure**. 

2 months is a short period of time to accomplish a self-produced project since we both have our regular jobs aside.
But keeping things simple, we hope to be able to create an interesting experience for the audience.

Let the fun begin!
