Our idea currently features a character that animates to match spectator's moves.
Beatrice has designed a very nice minimalistic 2d character.

Technically, the greatest challenge will probably be to 'skin' a 2d character from a 2d projection of our 3d tracking datas. In other words, we have to find a 2d drawing technique that can dynamically morph our character to any pose (face, profile..etc).

I have a simple idea that would use circles acting as spheres for the joints, ensuring a minimum thickness. But I'm not sure if that will work..

We should find out shortly :)
